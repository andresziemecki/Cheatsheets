# 1-Introduction

## Ranking

Optimizing Machine Learning models to rank candidates, such as music, article or products. Typically, the goal is to order the candidates such that the candidates which are most likely to be interacted with (purchased, viewd, like, etc.) are above other candidates that aren't as likely to be interacted with. 

For example, tiktok takes millions of tiktok, the filter them the first 100 and finally ranks then and show you the top ones according to your profile. The idea is to keep you scrolling infinitly.

## Supervised Learning

Optimizing Machine Learning models based on previously observed `features` and `labels`. Typically, the goal is to attach the most likely label to some provided features.

## Unsupervise Learning

An approach with Machine Learning that takes in unlabeled examples and produce patterns from the provided data. Typically, the goal is to discover something previously unknown about the unlabeled examples.

For example, when we want to group tweets together based on its content. And then later we will see in a few examples what kind of category those tweets are (policy, sports, etc) and then categorized instead of watching one by one.

## Deep Learning

Optimizing neural networks, often with many hidden layers, to perform unsupervised or supervised learning.

Comonly used with Images or Music which is not very well organized data features and labels. For example when an image has a truck or not. There is a lot of noise and information, which is not very clear or organized.

## Recommendation System

Systems with the goal of presenting an item to a user such that the user will most likely purchase, view, or like the recommendation item. Items can take many forms, such as music, movies, or products. Also called Recommender Systems.
