# 2 - Prerequisites

## Features

A set of quantitative properties describing an observation. They can be binary, categorical, continious or ordinal (its like a category but ordered, i.e. bad, medium, good, excelent).

## Labels

Can be discrete or continious. It's a pair based with a set of features for supervise learning. It's something that we want to know.

## Dimensions

Number of features associated with a particular examples.

## Vector

Here, a feature vector, which is a list of features representing a particular example.

## Matrix

An array of values, usually consisting of multiple rows and columns

## Matrix Transpose

An operator that flips a matrix over its diagonal

## Polynomial

A function with more than one variable/coefficient pair.

## Derivative

Indicates how much the output of a function will change with respect to a change an its input.

## Probability

How likely something is to occur. This can be independent, such as the roll of the dice, or conditional, such as drawing two cards subsequently out of a deck without replacement.

## Probability Distribution

A function that takes in an outcome and outputs the probability of that particular outcome ocurring. We have
- Gaussian
- Uniform
- Beta distribution: This is good if we want to model something such as rates. It's like a semi circule sentered in 0.5
So, let's suppose that we want to do a convertion of some model. Did they click on the add? Did they purchase a product? Did they view the video? 

## Gaussian Distribution

A very common type of probability distribution which fits many real world observations; also called a normal distribution.

## Uniform Distributtion

A probability Distribution in which each outcome is equally likely; for example, rolling a six-sided die.
