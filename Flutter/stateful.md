# Stateful Widgets

Change state over time.

The data that can change over time it's going to be store as state objects.

Shortcut to create one: `stful`

You will see that the `createState()` function instantiate a State object.

Inside the state widget we can define data and change it over time.

To change the state, whenever an event happend which call a function, possibly we'll need to add a `setState(){}` inside of that event.
